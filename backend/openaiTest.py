I'm writing on a paper analyzing on villanelle in killing eve. Here's my paper
""Killing Eve” is a British television series created by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, provides an interesting exploration of the complex character Villanelle played by Jodie Comer. Villanelle captures audiences with her blend of elegance, intelligence, and ruthlessness. She is a psychopathic serial killer hired by a secret organization which aims at creating chaos in politics. Another character Eve is an employee of MI5 investigating the cases created by Villanelle and has a subtle admiration on Villanelle. After they meet each other, they develop a strong emotion attachment which pushes them away from their own missions and closer with each other. Villanelle’s complex character exemplifies the complexity of human nature, challenging us to confront our own foibles and desires in the process.
First, Villanelle emerges as a compelling example of narcissism, driven by a relentless pursuit of power, recognition, and personal satisfaction. Throughout her interactions with Eve and others, Villanelle's narcissistic character trait are laid bare, revealing the depths of her ego, desire, and insecurity. One most obvious evidence is Villanelle's infatuation with Eve, the MI6 agent tasked with capturing her. Narcissistic always develop an excessive self-love (Stanzione, 2024), which exceed to feeling satisfied when they know others are noticing them. This can also explain why they always make great efforts on appearance. Alongside Villanelle's evident fashion taste, her craving for attention and validation from Eve stems from Eve's keen observation of her behavior. This dynamic reflects the narcissistic desire for admiration and recognition, as Villanelle basks in the acknowledgment of her talents and abilities. For example, in season 1, she was satisfied to see how much research Eve had done on her. Furthermore, Villanelle's attraction to Eve is fueled by their shared propensity for darkness and violence. Both characters harbor a capacity for cruelty and manipulation, forging a connection based on their mutual understanding of the darker aspects of human nature. Villanelle sees in Eve a kindred spirit, a reflection of her own shadow self, which further reinforces her fascination and desire for closeness. When Constantine asked her “What is it about her (Eve)?”, she answered “We are the same”. This can be seen through they both like to bully kids, and enjoy the process of k*lling.
Another significant trait of narcissists is they are inclined to engage in impulsive behaviors that provide short-term rewards but have long-term costs (Holtzman, 2010). Villanelle's joy in k*lling and penchant for attention-grabbing murders illustrate her desire for immediate gratification, regardless of the potential risks or complications, considering that her outstanding intelligence can surly let her pop up with clean and professional k*lling methods. In one notable instance, Villanelle's impulsive nature leads her to engage in a messy assassination, disregarding the potential repercussions for the sake of her own pleasure. This pattern of behavior reflects her inability to consider the long-term implications of her actions, driven instead by the thrill of the moment. This can also be reflected by her hobby in purchasing luxuries even when she was once in finical struggle. Moreover, Villanelle's promiscuity and disregard for sexual boundaries mirror her tendency to indulge in short-term pleasures without regard for the emotional or relational consequences (Reise, 1996). Over the series, she had developed times more sexual partner than Eve. Her pursuit of pleasure becomes a central aspect of her narcissistic personality, driving her to seek out fleeting moments of satisfaction at any cost."
Could you please write a paragraph on describing the benefits and drawbacks of using single trait approach on analyzing the character based on the stuffs you just wrote?'''
